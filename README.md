# GeoCSV QGIS plugin

**Problem to solve**
After loading Delimited Text Layer (like CSV files) in QGIS you cannot edit and interact with it as vector layer at all. 
This simple plugin creates Temporary Vector Layer from Delimited Text Layer just in a second that allows you to add, delete, move or move any features you want.  

**Usage**

1) Add Delimited Text Layer via Layer->Add Layer->Add Delimited Text Layer...
2) Open GeoCSV plugin window via Plugins->GeoCSV
3) Select a Delimited Text Layer you want to transform to Temporary Vector Layer
4) Click "OK"
5) Enjoy!
